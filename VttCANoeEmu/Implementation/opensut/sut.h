 *  The SUT will execute asynchronously until the budget is used up.

 *  The function returns immediately, even if SUT execution is still ongoing.
 *  The execution model is as-fast-as-possible, meaning that internal timers do not consume any wallclock time.
 *  If a coupling between real and virtual time is needed, this function should be called repeatedly with sufficiently
 *  small time slices, with sleep intervals in between. A main loop in such is sketched below:
 *  \code{.c}
 *   clock_t real_start = clock();
 *   opensut_time_t real_now, lead_time, virtual_now = 0, increment = 1000000; // 1ms

 *       usleep((useconds_s)(lead_time / 1000)); // Compensate by suspending execution.
 *     // Negative lead time would mean that SUT executes slower than real-time.
 *   }
 *  \endcode
 *  The function can be called, when the SUT is already in state running, which means, that the budget of the
 *  the previous call is not used up yet. In this case, the new time budget for SUT execution is the sum of the
 *  remain budget from the previous call and the budget from the new call.
 *
 *  @param in_diff_time virtual time budget

 *  - OPENSUT_OK if successful

/*! Retrieves the (future) timestamp of the next pending event
 *  while SUT is in 'paused' state. This function might be useful for the realization of coupling algorithms
 *  between virtual time and real time: Since the SUT follows an as-fast-as-possible execution model, it needs
 *  to be throttled by stressing the intervals between calls to opensut_run_async_for(). But in what granularity
 *  should we make those calls? opensut_get_time_of_next_event() may support this decision with facts in that it returns
 *  the timestamp of the next pending event. The difference between that timestamp and the current virtual time is the
 *  time jump which will happen when calling opensut_run_async_for(). For achieving close-to-real-time behavior, we
 *  should accomodate for that time jump by consuming actual wallclock time.
 *  A good strategy might be to accept "small" (e.g. < 100µs) time jumps without any action, but to compensate for
 *  larger jumps by suspending execution until wallclock time has reached the future virtual time.

 *  object is in non signaled state, when no callback is queued and the SUT is in state running. Synchronizing with the
 *  notification object depends on the operating system: Under Windows, out_handle maps to a HANDLE which may be passed
 *  to WaitForMultipleObjects (or similar API calls). Under Linux, out_handle maps to a file descriptor, which may be
 *  passed to epoll_wait. The handle is valid as long as the SUT is 'initialized' state. Its lifetime is managed by API
 *  implementation. Hence, it is not necessary to close it.

 *  (calling opensut_shutdown() whilst in 'running' state). Then returns.
 *  All callbacks are made in context of the calling thread.
 *  @param in_timeout depicts the wallclock(!) time-out to wait. A value of 0 means that the function just processes
 *  those callbacks which already are in the queue and then returns immediately (typically with OPENSUT_TIMEOUT).
 *  A value of OPENSUT_TIME_INFINITE causes the function to wait indefinitely until one of the remaining conditions
 *  becomes true.
 *  @return
 *  - OPENSUT_OK if call was successful and the SUT is now in 'paused' state
 *  - OPENSUT_TIMEOUT if SUT is still in 'running' state, due to elapsed in_timeout. This is not an error
 *    condition. The function may have processed several callbacks prior to returning OPENSUT_TIMEOUT.
 *  - OPENSUT_PARAMETER_INVALID if in_timeout is invalid
 *  - OPENSUT_NOTINITIALIZED if SUT is uninitialized.
 *  - OPENSUT_FAILED if an error occurred during execution of the callbacks.
