/*! Describes a communication item.
 *  A communication item is a generic communication channel between a SUT and its environment.
 *  It is intended for application-level exchange of data which are not mapped to network communication.
 *  Typical uses: Representing analog or digital I/O, ECU control signals (power, reset),
 *  AUTOSAR VFB-level interfacing, generic model I/O like with Functional Mockup Interface (FMI).
 *  There are two fundamental kinds of communication items: data items and function objects.
 *  Data items provide signal-oriented data exchange. The dataflow can be from environment to SUT,
 *  from SUT to environment, or bidirectional. Data items support exchanging any serializable data.
 *  A description of an item's data type (which includes its binary serialization) can be obtained from
 *  opensut_data_item_get_type().
 *  RPC objects support asynchronous "remote" procedure calls. In this context, the notion "remote" does not
 *  necessarily refer to process boundaries. However, the context from which we initiate calls to the SUT or accept
 *  calls from the SUT, respectively, resides conceptually "outside" the SUT. We still need to serialize call
 *  parameters forth and back and need to cope with asynchrony, since the SUT's threading model is isolated from ours.
 *  Any RPC object is either inbound (SUT is server) or outbound (SUT is client). A description of the RPC object
 *  function parameters type (which includes its binary serialization) can be obtained from
 *  opensut_rpc_object_arg_get_type().
